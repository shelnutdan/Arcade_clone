# Udacity Classic Game Clone
## Introduction
This a rerendering of the classic game frogger. The primary goal it is to get the character icon over to the water without colliding with
the enemey bugs. If you reach the water you proceed to the next level and and earn 1000 points, if you get hit by an enemy you lose a life and start at the begining of the stage.
IF you lose all three of your lives you are displayed a game over modal that displays at the bottom. You are given your score for this round of playing and you can choose to play again.
Also, after every five levels a new enemy is randomly spawned, and after every ten levels you gain an extra life. There is no time limit and there is no max level. So try to get as high a score as possible.
